# ONGC_internship_project
The project 'Internship Coordinating Tool' was developed as a part of Summer Internship Project.

Currently the process in the organization is manual, i.e. the student or intern's candidate need to fill a paper form, and also need to submit it by hand to the office. The officials then update all the applications manually to their system and then respond individually to the selected students.

Internship Coordinating Tool is a comprehensive tool for coordinating the registration process of the industrial training online with the goal of registering and selecting the interns in a hassle free manner.
It handles the process of registration by the student, selection of applicants, confirming and informing the students about their selection.
